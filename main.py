# DONE: parameters search - https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/hyperparameter_tuning_with_hparams
# found that 8-10 epochs works well, number of nodes doesn't make a big difference
# DONE: support time since last meal
# DONE: add target, futureCob, minSinceLastCarb to model/training
# DONE: support temp target - done in AAPS
# DONE: account for future cob - right now doesn't show up in COB - done in AAPS
# DONE: tag low preventions - include as adjustments in records
# DONE: tag low preventions - download
# DONE: move smb adjustments into code rather than excel
# DONE: remove maxSMB/Iob from model
# DONE: add safety preventions in android
# DONE: expand date data
# DONE: add more layers to model
# DONE: figure out & use total IOB
# DONE: get exercise/step count data from phone sensor data
# DONE: get max IOB & max SMB from preferences
# DONE: Record data in app
# DONE: generate some data based on current settings
# DONE: implement safety - max IOB, max Bolus
# DONE: Round pump request to .05
# DONE: Header in csv
# DONE: Load model from file for faster feedback loop


# features to add:
# DONE: cob
# Done - glucose, delta, short delta, long delta, noise
# Partially done - day of week, hour of day, AM/PM, holiday
